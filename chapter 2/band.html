<dt><strong>I Love You.</strong> (2013)</dt>
<dd> This was one of the first albums I've heard from The Neighbourhood. It introduced me to the genre of indie rock. I would give this album an 8/10. My favorite songs from this album are Flawless, Let It Go, and W.D.Y.W.F.M.</dd>

<dt><strong>Hard To Imagine The Neighbourhood Ever Changing</strong> (2018)</dt>
<dd> This is my favorite album from The Neighbourhood. It has many of my favorite songs, including Softcore, Void, Reflections, Nervous, and Sadderdaze. I think this album is perfect; I would give it a 10/10.</dd>

<dt><strong>Chip Chrome & The Mono-Tones</strong> (2020)</dt>
<dd>This is one of their relatively newer albums. Chip Chrome is Jesse Rutherford's alter ego. He created this album, which took certain aspects from how David Bowie predicted the future vision of the music industry. Three of my favorite songs from this album are Pretty Buy, Devil's Advocate, and Cherry Flavoured.</dd>
